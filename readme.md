# Postgres API

An intended answer to a byte-dept technical interview question

I totally misunderstood this question, and thought it was asking for a _way_ to query a database, so I ended up making an API, haha... It was only after I was nearly finished that I double-checked and realised it only wanted an SQL query.

Uploading this because it was still a pretty interesting learning experience.
